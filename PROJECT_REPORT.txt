## Abstract

This project presents the design and implementation of a comprehensive e-commerce platform built using modern web technologies. The system provides a robust, scalable solution for online retail operations, featuring a complete customer shopping experience and administrative management interface. The application utilizes a full-stack JavaScript architecture with React.js for the frontend, Node.js/Express.js for the backend API, and MongoDB for data persistence. The platform integrates third-party services including PayPal for payment processing and Cloudinary for image management, delivering an enterprise-grade e-commerce solution with features including user authentication, product catalog management, shopping cart functionality, order processing, and comprehensive administrative controls.

## Methodology

The system was constructed using a modern full-stack development approach with clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend components.

### **Frontend Architecture (React.js + Vite)**
The client-side application was built using React.js with Vite as the build tool for optimal development experience and production performance. Key architectural decisions include:

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Modular React components organized by feature areas (auth, admin, shopping)
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit for centralized application state management across authentication, products, cart, and orders
- **Routing:** React Router for client-side navigation with protected routes and role-based access control
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling with custom UI components
- **Form Handling:** Custom form components with validation for user inputs

```javascript
// Store configuration with multiple slices
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    auth: authReducer,
    adminProducts: AdminProductSlice,
    shoppingProducts: shoppingProductSlice,
    shoppingCart: shoppingCart,
    shopAddress: shopAddressSlice,
    shoppingOrder: shopOrderSlice
  }
});
```

### **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express.js)**
The server-side API was implemented using Node.js and Express.js following RESTful principles with modular route organization:

- **MVC Architecture:** Separation of routes, controllers, and models for maintainable code structure
- **Database Integration:** MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for schema definition and data operations
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with secure HTTP-only cookies
- **File Upload:** Multer middleware for handling product image uploads to Cloudinary
- **Payment Processing:** PayPal REST SDK integration for secure payment handling

```javascript
// Express server setup with middleware and routes
app.use(cors({
  origin: "http://localhost:5173",
  credentials: true
}));
app.use("/api/auth", authRouter);
app.use("/api/admin/products", adminProductRouter);
app.use("/api/shop/products", shopProductRouter);
```

### **Database Design (MongoDB)**
The application uses MongoDB with well-structured schemas for different entities:

- **User Schema:** User authentication and role management
- **Product Schema:** Product catalog with images, pricing, and inventory
- **Order Schema:** Complete order tracking with cart items and payment status
- **Cart Schema:** Shopping cart persistence across sessions
- **Address Schema:** Customer shipping address management

### **Third-Party Service Integration**
- **Cloudinary:** Cloud-based image storage and transformation for product images
- **PayPal SDK:** Secure payment processing with sandbox/production environment support

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### **State Management Architecture**
```javascript
// Redux slice for shopping cart management
export const addToCart = createAsyncThunk(
  '/cart/addToCart',
  async ({ userId, productId, quantity }) => {
    const response = await axios.post(
      'http://localhost:5000/api/shop/cart/add',
      { userId, productId, quantity }
    );
    return response.data;
  }
);
```

### **Authentication System**
```javascript
// JWT-based authentication with secure cookie storage
const token = jwt.sign(payLoad, process.env.SECRET_KEY, {
  expiresIn: 3600
});
return res.cookie("token", token, { 
  httpOnly: true, 
  secure: false 
}).json({
  success: true,
  user: userData
});
```
