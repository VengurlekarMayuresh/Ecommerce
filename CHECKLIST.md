```powershell
# Check logs
az webapp log tail --name YOUR_APP --resource-group ecommerce-rg

# Restart app service
az webapp restart --name YOUR_APP --resource-group ecommerce-rg
```

### If Frontend Build Fails:
- Check `output_location` in workflow matches Vite build output (`dist`)
- Verify all dependencies in `client/package.json`
- Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors

### If Database Connection Fails:
- Verify MongoDB connection string
- Check Azure App Service outbound IP addresses
- Whitelist IPs in MongoDB Atlas

### If Images Don't Upload:
- Check `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` is set
- Verify blob container exists
- Check container has public blob access
